## init folder
Stores a combination of templated and non-templated files that all get combined together into the initially loaded page of this app.

## parts folder
Stores subcomponents of the application- I dont think any of these are templated.

## worker.js
A templated (jinja) file that caches all the necessary assets for theoretical offline use. P.S. your IDE may go crazy from the jinja.
