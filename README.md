# Weather-Lite
A PWA that visualizes weather.
It features saving favorite locations, rain forecasts, heatmaps, etc.

Live Demo here: https://weatherlite.app

The config.ini file will need to be updated with the appropriate api keys before localrun will work.

I have commented each file out pretty well. So it should prove pretty easy to reverse engineer.
